# Making-a-secure-web-app
The final project (undertaken during the last 2 weeks) of the Makers Academy course.
The aim of this project is to gain insight and understanding in cyber security.
A simple web app was created (a basic twitter clone) without the use of frameworks and little use of libraries. This app was then used to exploit and document various security flaws, and importantly their countermeasures.

### Setup
Getting the repo:
```$ git clone https://github.com/LarsFin/Making-a-secure-web-app.git
   $ cd Making-a-secure-web-app```
Configuring environment:
```$ ruby db-reset.rb
   $ bundle install```
Running tests:
```$ rspec```
Running app:
```ruby server.db```
  then visit
```https://localhost:3000```
